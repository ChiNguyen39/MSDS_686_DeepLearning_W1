## Development Environment
If you want to run these notebooks locally on your machine, you can use [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) to create a dedicated Python environment.

Execute
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
to create a new conda environment named `msds-686`, followed by
```
conda activate msds-686
```
in order to use the Python dependencies declared in the `environment.yml` file. Make sure when running a Jupyter notebook, you are using the `msds-686` kernel.
